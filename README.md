# Sudoku Validator

The Sudoku Validator is a Java program that validates a Sudoku puzzle using multithreading. It checks if the given Sudoku puzzle is valid by ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains the digits 1 through 9 without repetition.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the Sudoku Validator program, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the source code files are located.

## Compiling the Program

To compile the Sudoku Validator program, use the following command:

`javac SudokuValidator.java`

This command compiles the `SudokuValidator.java` file and generates the corresponding `.class` files.

## Running the Program

To run the Sudoku Validator program, use the following command:

java SudokuValidator

This command executes the `main()` method in the `SudokuValidator` class, which demonstrates the usage of the Sudoku Validator.

## Modifying the Sudoku Puzzle

By default, the program uses a predefined Sudoku puzzle grid for validation. If you want to validate a different Sudoku puzzle, you can modify the `grid` array in the `main()` method of the `SudokuValidator` class.

Update the values in the `grid` array to represent your Sudoku puzzle. Each row of the puzzle corresponds to a subarray in the `grid` array, and each digit in the puzzle is represented by an integer value.

For example, to validate a different Sudoku puzzle, you can modify the `grid` array as follows:

`int[][] grid = {
    {5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2},
    {6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8},
    {1, 9, 8, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7},
    {8, 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 2, 3},
    {4, 2, 6, 8, 5, 3, 7, 9, 1},
    {7, 1, 3, 9, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6},
    {9, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 4},
    {2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 9, 6, 3, 5},
    {3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 6, 1, 7, 9}
};`

This command compiles the `SudokuValidator.java` file and generates the corresponding `.class` files.

After modifying the `grid` array, save the changes and recompile the program using the `javac` command mentioned earlier.

## Validation Result

After running the program, it will display the validation result in the console. If the Sudoku puzzle is valid, it will print "The Sudoku puzzle is valid." Otherwise, it will print "The Sudoku puzzle is not valid."

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while compiling or running the program, ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed correctly and the necessary environment variables are set up properly.
